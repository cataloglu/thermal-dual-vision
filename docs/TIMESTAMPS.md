# Video timestamps

All timestamps on event videos (MP4, collage, GIF) are **server time** – the time when we captured the frame. We never read or use the camera’s on-screen display (OSD).

- **Settings → Live → overlay_timezone**
  - **`local`** (default): overlay in server’s local time.
  - **`utc`**: overlay in UTC.

Everything runs according to server time (UTC or local by region). Camera OSD is not used.
