# Product Definition (v2)

## Purpose
Thermal Dual Vision is an event-first security product that detects motion, enriches it with AI analysis when enabled, and notifies operators through a focused, dark UI. The product prioritizes reliability, clear event context, and fast operator response.

## Target User
- Facilities/security operators
- Small industrial sites
- Home Assistant / edge deployments

## Core User Goals
1) Add a camera and keep it connected.
2) Configure per-camera motion sensitivity and thresholds.
3) See a list of motion/analysis events.
4) Inspect an event with collage, AI text, and video.

## Non-Goals (v2 scope)
- Live view / continuous streaming UI
- Gallery mode or media browsing outside events
- Admin template dashboards

## Product Principles
- Event-centric: everything orbits the event list and event detail.
- Dark-only: low-glare, high-contrast UI.
- Data-first: show real values only; no placeholders or mock data.
- Safe by default: never expose secrets; mask and redact sensitive fields.
