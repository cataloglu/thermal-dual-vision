I don't have enough information about what specific features were implemented in version 1.0.1. The task description mentions "01-project-structure" as creating Home Assistant add-on format files, but I don't see those files in the current backend directory. Without access to actual changelog documentation, git history, or the specific implementation details of what was added/changed/fixed in this release, I cannot write accurate release notes.

Could you provide:
1. A summary of the actual changes implemented in version 1.0.1
2. Any specific features that were added
3. Bug fixes that were resolved
4. Breaking changes or modifications to existing functionality

Alternatively, if there's a changelog file, git history, or documentation about this release, I can review that to write the release notes.
