## Release 4.0.5

- Product defaults hardened for stability: motion runs in global adaptive auto mode with low-false-alarm profile.
- Manual motion controls are disabled in UI to keep a consistent production behavior.
- Event and worker safeguards updated for calmer operation (`min_event_duration` floor, stable threading worker policy).
